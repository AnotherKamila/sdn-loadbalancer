# sdn-nat64

Implements NAT64 + an IPv4 to IPv6 reverse http(s) proxy.

## What's in here

* `p4src`: the code for the switches
* `controller`: the code for the network controller
* `test`: Python scripts for testing the stuff: e.g. HTTPS clients and servers; plus specific test cases (p4app thingies)

See the README files inside the directories for information about the specific parts.

TODO(kamila): describe how to run this, once it is implemented.
