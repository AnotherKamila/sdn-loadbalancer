# "Load-aware" L4 load balancing

class: contrast, expanded, middle

# Aims

1. **Implement an L4 load balancer**  
   have a server pool with multiple actual servers
2. **Be able to choose the _distribution_:**  
   if a server is busy, it should get fewer new connections

---

# Simple L4 load balancer

.floatright[.qrcode[![QR code](./img/how-routers-work.svg)]]

**Up to L3: it is a router**  
Details: [How do routers really work?](https://kamila.is/teaching/how-routers-work/)

**Address rewriting on L4:**

  * kind of like the ECMP exercise
  * mind the return path

also: TCP checksum

# Changing the distribution

Three problems:

1. Which distribution to choose?
2. How to implement load balancing with a given distribution?
3. How to dynamically change the distribution while there are active connections?

# Changing the distribution

Three problems:

1. **Which distribution to choose? ⇒ not SDN**
2. How to implement load balancing with a given distribution?
3. How to dynamically change the distribution while there are active connections?

2. is not that interesting

# Weighted load balancing

Same as the equal-cost case, except we add the server multiple times:

.center[![buckets](./img/buckets.svg)]

blue server will get 2/5 of requests,  
pink server will get 3/5

**Disadvantage:** table gets big quickly

---

# Idea: Making the table smaller

How can we conceptually add an entry N times with fewer actual entries?

Idea: Instead of using an exact match on the hash, use a prefix match!  
It's just bit strings, who says they have to be addresses...

---

# The problem:

.center.width80[![hash problem](./img/hash-problem.svg)]

--

**Fix:** Keep assigned connections in a table

.center.width100[![conn table](./img/connections.svg)]

???

get rewritten directly, and don't even need to be hashed  

---

# The second problem:

Table writes are not instant:

.center.width95[![outstanding](./img/timeline.svg)]

--

**Fix:** Keep old pool data,
discard only after all connections using them are in `conn_table`

---

# Not breaking connections

.center.width90[![pinkbox](./img/pinkbox.svg)]

---

# Old pool data???

**Fix:** Versioned tables:

```c
table ipv4_dips {
    key = {
*       meta.version: exact;
        meta.server_pool: exact;
        meta.flow_hash: exact;
    }
    ...
}
```

* write to a register from the control plane to set the active version
* **bonus:** transactions for free: poke at a "scratch" table version and only flip when ready

---

# The fourth problem:

For a given connection, how do we know which pool version it belongs to (if any)?

--

**Fix:**

Hard-code a few "version slots" (I use 4).

Use a Bloom filter (set membership) to decide if the packet belongs to version slot _i_.

Cycle through the available version slots.

# Life of a packet

.center.width100[![flow diagram](./img/life-of-a-packet.svg)]

---

# Bloom filters: Controller

1. Need to track outstanding writes
   ⇒ make table writes asynchronous:
    ```python
    def recv_packet(self, packet):
        ...
        self.pending_writes[version].append(
            self.conn_table.add(...))  # async
    ```

2. Wait for completion before overwriting a version:
    ```python
    def commit(self):
        await DeferredList(
            self.pending_writes[self.vips.next_version])
        ...
    ```

.right.footnote[\* `await` is actually spelled `yield` in Python 2 + Twisted &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]

---

# How not to go crazy

1.  Each component is written and tested separately:
    ```py
    class Router(IPv4Routing, ArpLazy,
                    L2SwitchLazy, BaseController):
        pass  # :D
    ```
2. Asynchronous (using the [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/) framework)
    * easier to handle `conn_table` writes correctly (see before)
    * makes it much easier to test things
3. Tests!

???

Cleanly structured code

exclude: true

# Tests

* integration tests
* launch `p4run`
* run and communicate with clients, servers, and controller

```py
@pt.inlineCallbacks
def test_add_dip(remote_module, p4run):
    client, server, lb = ...
    ...
    pool_h = yield lb.add_pool('10.0.0.1', 8000)
    yield lb.add_dip(pool_h, p4run.IP['h2'], 8001)
    ...
    yield client.callRemote('make_connections',
        '10.0.0.1', 8000, count=47)
    num_conns = yield server.callRemote('get_conn_count')
    assert num_conns == 47
```

# Tests example: Single run

TODO re-record with prints for starting servers & clients

---

# Tests example: Session

---

# Demo

# Conclusion

* project completed:
  * TODO screenshot of graph
  * table versioning + Bloom filters to find version
* bonus:
    * universal abstraction over P4 tables with async writes, atomic operations (`.commit()`), transparent versioning
    * composable controllers for L2 and L3
    * integration tests made easy
