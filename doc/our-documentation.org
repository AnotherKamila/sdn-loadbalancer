* Decisions
** We don't care about mac addresses, because we are a router (2018-11-09)
*** This implies we learn IP to Port mappings (don't care about mac addresses!)
** master branch is always stable
*** to be always able to merge w/o headache
** In simple 1:1 NAT64 we DON'T do any IPv4 / IPv6 calculations
