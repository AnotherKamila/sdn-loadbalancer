* Decisions
** We don't care about mac addresses, because we are a router (2018-11-09)
*** This implies we learn IP to Port mappings (don't care about mac addresses!)
** master branch is always stable
*** to be always able to merge w/o headache
** In simple 1:1 NAT64 we DON'T do any IPv4 / IPv6 calculations
* Meeting notes / preparation
** 2018-11-15
*** What we have done
**** Defining the initial set of tasks
**** Discussion about ARP/NDP/L2/L3 split, architecture definition
**** L2 switching
**** IPv4 and IPv6 parsing
*** What we have not done
**** 1:1 NAT64
*** What are our next steps
**** Merge L3 code
**** Finish 1:1 NAT64 code
**** Test 1:1 NAT64
